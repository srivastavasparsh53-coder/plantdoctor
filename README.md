🌱 PlantDoctor

AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection & Solution System

«PlantDoctor is an AI-powered web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using Deep Learning and provides disease-related information and solutions.»

---

✨ Overview

PlantDoctor combines Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Flask, and Generative AI to create an easy-to-use plant disease detection system.

Users can upload or capture a plant-leaf image, receive a predicted disease with a confidence score, and get a natural-language explanation with relevant information and solutions.

The project was developed as a College Mini Project with a focus on practical AI/ML implementation.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/abhishekyadav1118/PlantDoctor.git
cd PlantDoctor

2. Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv

3. Activate Environment

Windows PowerShell:

venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

4. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Configure Gemini API

Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable instead of placing it directly inside the source code.

PowerShell:

$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

The project uses environment variables to keep the API key out of the source code.

6. Run the Backend

python app.py

7. Open the Application

📱 Mobile Testing

PlantDoctor can also be tested from a phone connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the laptop.

The backend can listen on all network interfaces and determine the laptop's local IP address for easier team/mobile testing.

🔄 How It Works

1. User uploads / captures leaf image
                ↓
2. Image preprocessing
                ↓
3. MobileNetV2 model prediction
                ↓
4. Disease + confidence generated
                ↓
5. Disease information retrieved

🔐 Security

API credentials should never be hardcoded inside the source code.

PlantDoctor uses environment variables for the Gemini API key, helping keep sensitive credentials outside the application code.

The project includes:

- Localhost testing
- Same-WiFi phone testing
- Browser debugging
- CORS troubleshooting
- Iterative bug fixing
- Mobile camera/upload testing
